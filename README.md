# BankSim

**Purpose of Assignment:**
The goal of the assignment is to gain a better understanding of multithreading programming and how race conditions can occur in your program and how you should try to resolve them. We needed to observe and resolve the race condition in a multi-thread program. We were given a prototype bank fund transferring simulation program which did not have any means to protect the critical part of the code to prevent race condition. So race condition always happens when it runs. Therefore, we had to do multiple tasks to resolve the various race conditions in the code.
